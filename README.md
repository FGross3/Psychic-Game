# Psychic-Game

- This project is a first attempt at making a functional browser-based "game" utilizing JavaScript

- While the code does work as intended, there are several additions I would like to add in the coming days:
    1. Improved CSS
    2. A theme to the guessing game along with corresponding pictures and sound effects

- The code I have put together seems clunky and repetitive.  As I learn more, I fully expect to be able to simplify the script.
